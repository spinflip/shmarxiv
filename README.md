# ShmarXiv

shmarXiv = shell-based markovian arXiv generator game

## Description

This is a simple toy code inspired by arXiv vs. snarXiv (https://snarxiv.org/vs-arxiv/) to play the game whether a paper title is real or made up using Markov chains. In contrast with arXiv vs. snarXiv it can harvest information from latest papers and selected cond-mat papers.
